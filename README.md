This scriot is my first project on bash shell, so don't guge me too hard, I would like to hear some code review and advises how to get better
The scrtipt have two modes, -d (defoalt) and -m(manual) 
By default, the script will spoof the MAC and the IP address. (In the future i wall add the option of spoofing the hostname)
In default mode he will use the pricet .txt files, so it important to keep them in the same folder 
If you want to Enter them manualy, you have to tap: -m (for manual mode) -mc for the MAC address (then insert the address) and -ip for the ip (da).
